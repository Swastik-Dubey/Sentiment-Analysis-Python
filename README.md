# Python Sentiment Analysis Project with NLTK and ðŸ¤— Transformers

## Overview
This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Python application that implements a Sentiment Analysis classifier using NLTK's VADER and Huggingface's RoBERTa Transformers. The goal of the project is to classify the sentiment of Amazon customer reviews, helping data scientists understand and model language sentiment.

ðŸ¤— Transformers provides excellent open-source models for NLP, which we leverage to enhance our sentiment analysis. You can find these models at [Hugging Face Models](https://huggingface.co/models).

## Project Parts
1. **Introduction**
   An overview of the project and its significance in language modeling.

2. **Setup + NLTK**
   Instructions on setting up the project and incorporating the NLTK library for Natural Language Processing.

3. **VADER Model**
   Implementation and usage of the VADER sentiment analysis model from NLTK.

4. **RoBERTa Model**
   Integration of Huggingface's RoBERTa Transformer for sentiment analysis.

5. **Compare Results**
   A section dedicated to comparing the results obtained from both NLTK's VADER and Huggingface's RoBERTa, highlighting the differences and insights gained.



## Usage
This project is designed as a single Colab file, and you can easily execute each section sequentially. Follow the instructions in each part to set up the environment, import necessary libraries, and run the code blocks.

### Important Note
Make sure to have the required libraries installed by checking the dependencies in the notebook.

## Conclusion
Sentiment analysis is a crucial tool for data scientists to understand and model language effectively. This project explores the capabilities of both NLTK and Huggingface's Transformers in sentiment analysis and provides a valuable comparison between the two approaches.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs. Happy coding!
